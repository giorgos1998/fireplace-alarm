# fireplace-alarm

This project uses a MQ-2 gas sensor for arduino, a 3-pin buzzer and 3 LEDs (One green and 2 red).
The sensitivity of the MQ-2 sensor can be easily adjusted within the code from the sensorThres parameter.
Take into consideration that the gas sensor needs about 5 minutes to heat up in order to work properly. Also, try not to touch it with anything cold while it is working, as it briefly decreases it's accuracy.
